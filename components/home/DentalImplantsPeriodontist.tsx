            <p className="text-[#2d2d2d] font-sans leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Dental implants are titanium posts that are surgically placed into the jawbone to replace missing tooth roots. At The Tooth Studio Colaba, our periodontist performs comprehensive evaluation and treatment planning before implant placement. This includes detailed examination of the implant site, bone quality assessment, and medical history review to ensure optimal candidacy for implant therapy.
            </p>
            <p className="text-[#2d2d2d] font-sans leading-relaxed">
              The implant procedure at our Colaba location is performed under local anesthesia with sedation options available for patient comfort. After creating a precise opening in the bone, the titanium implant is carefully placed at the optimal position and depth. The implant is then covered with gum tissue and allowed to integrate with the bone through a process called osseointegration, which typically takes 3-6 months.
